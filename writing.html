		<p>I find it interesting that tourists love visiting New York City, also known as the big apple. Yet some of the residents of New York City do not appreciate most of the things the city has to offer. I happen to be one of those people who lives in the city but does not get to enjoy all the things that drive hordes to travelers to come through JFK every day. Due to the fact that I’m taking this course, I have been able to see these momentous sites for the first time. It is embarrassing that I, as a New Yorker, have to discover the city I live in all over again, almost as if for the first time. One of the most fascinating places I’ve gotten to explore is Greenwich Village, its history, culture, and neighborhoods.
	One of our stops on this tour was the Washington Square Park. It was  crowded when we went. I was happy when Professor Sparr let us roam the park for a while in order for us to get a really good feeling about the place. There was so much going on everywhere I turned, that it was a little bit overwhelming at first. The first thing that I noticed was the huge fountain area located in the center of the park. I could tell the area was popular due to the fact that the fountain was highly populated by visitors. Some people sat down and put their feet in the water, while others ate their lunch and enjoyed the scenery. A lot of people were taking pictures of the fountain.
	I noticed a lot of talented people in the park. There was a group of young guys that were break-dancing to hip-hop music, surrounded by a crowd in awe of their talent. I noticed a few people putting money in their bucket. Another talented person that I saw was a guy sitting down on the concrete floor drawing a mural of Prince. The artist was not quite yet finished with his mural but he drew enough for onlookers to notice that it was Prince that he was drawing. In hindsight, I wish I had asked him how long it took to complete a typical mural like the one I saw.
	The most exciting part for me about Washington Square Park was my encounter with two huge snakes that I was encouraged to put around my neck. I have to say that it was worth my last $4. Out of the entire class, I was shocked that I was the only one brave enough to hold the snakes. I found it entertaining   that some of my classmates were running away and screaming when the owners of the snakes got close to them with the snakes in hand. The only negative aspect of the experience  was the owners fed the snakes before having me hold them, because my neck was in so much pain for about an hour.
	Washington Square Park would not be the park that it is today if Jane Jacobs had not stopped her husband Robert Moses from making a huge mistake; Moses wanted to build multiple projects in the park. “The battles over all three projects form the spine of “Wrestling With Moses” (Garner, 2009). Those projects were clearly insane and would have had huge effects on the quality of life in Manhattan. Now New York University owns most of the buildings surrounding Washington Square Park, since it always wanted to expand its Greenwich Village campus. “NYU 2031 proposal is to construct some 2.5 million square feet (the rough equivalent of the Empire State Building) over the next 20 years on a pair of superblocks owned by the university below Washington Square Park. The blocks are now dominated by midcentury lower-in-the-park faculty residences called Washington Square Village and University Village” (Kimmelman, 2012). I find it convenient that some of the buildings that have been built are now converted into residential and academic buildings. During the tour we saw a few of the buildings that were owned by New York University, including their study center. The center was huge and very formal.
	The last part of the tour that I personally enjoyed visiting was the Stonewall Inn a historically prominent gay bar in the city; the Stonewall Riots which started as a violent demonstration against police raids, marked the beginning of the gay rights movement in the United States. “On June 28, 1970 the first gay pride marches took place in LA, NY, and Chicago” (Sparr, 2016). Greenwich Village is the foundation of the modern LGBT movement after WWI. I consider myself a supporter of the LGBT movement, and find it abominable that queer people, including some members of my family continue to be mistreated and chastised because their lives don’t conform to the norm. Overall, Greenwich Village is a great neighborhood to visit. So many different types of people, from different backgrounds make it one big, thriving melting pot.
